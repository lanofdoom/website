The LAN of DOOM was born in Lake Forest, IL from the merger of multiple LAN
groups that had until then been meeting separately. The exact chronology is now
lost to time, but the precursor groups go at least as far back as early 2005 and
possibly as early as late 2004 since some of the earliest games we played were
[Counter-Strike: Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Strike:_Source)
and [Battlefield 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlefield_2) which were new
at the time.

While the exact date of the first merged LAN is long forgotten, the first LAN
party to bear the LAN of DOOM was on November 16, 2007 and we continue to meet
both online and in-person to this day.
