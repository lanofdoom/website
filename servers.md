| Counter-Strike: Source | Lake Forest | connect lf.lanofdoom.com       |

All Source servers (other than L4D2) require membership in the
[WAN of DOOM](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/wanofdoom/) Steam group in
order to join. Additionally, existing members of the WAN of DOOM group can allow
non-members to join the servers by entering the `allowjoin` command in chat.
This command will grant temporary access to the next user that attempts to join
the server without credentials.
